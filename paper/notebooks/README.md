# notebooks/

Read-only provenance notebooks captured during manuscript preparation (runs, logs, and figure assembly notes).

These notebooks are optional and provided for transparency.
Panel verification is supported by the exported Source Data in `../source_data/`, indexed by `../FIGURE_MAP.csv`.
Some notebooks may depend on large public inputs and computing.

Note on LLM calls: we fix local random seeds for deterministic preprocessing; however, LLM API outputs may still vary across runs even with temperature=0.
