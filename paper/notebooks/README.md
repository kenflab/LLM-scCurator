# notebooks/

This folder contains read-only provenance notebooks used during  manuscript preparation (runs, logs, and figure assembly notes).

Notebooks are **optional** and are provided for inspection/provenance.
- Canonical numeric Source Data lives in `paper/source_data/`.
- Selected scripts in `paper/scripts/` can render/verify a subset of panels from precomputed Source Data.
- Large outputs (e.g., `.h5ad`, images, caches) should not be committed here.
