abstract: >
  LLM-scCurator is a Python framework that standardizes noise-aware marker
  distillation (clonotype/housekeeping/stress suppression with rescue and lineage
  leakage filters) before prompting a large language model, enabling robust
  hierarchical (coarse-to-fine) zero-shot annotation for single-cell and spatial
  transcriptomic data.
